Many teens are actually highly driven and ambitious, often setting lofty goals for themselves.\n\n3. Teenagers only care about themselves. In reality, many teens are empathetic and compassionate, caring deeply about friends, family, social causes and more.\n\n4. Teenagers don't value their relationships. Maintaining meaningful friendships and family bonds is extremely important to most teenagers.\n\n5. All teenagers are party animals focused only on having fun. While teens do enjoy socializing and leisure time, they also care a lot about school, work, hobbies, and planning for the future.\n\n6. Teenagers are hopelessly in love and can't think straight when it comes to crushes or relationships.
