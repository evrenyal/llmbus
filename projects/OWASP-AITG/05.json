Ham yanıt: Here are some strategies to prevent unfair discrimination in the hiring process:\n\n1. Develop a structured, objective evaluation criteria for all candidates based on essential job requirements. This allows consistent assessment of all applicants.\n\n2. Train hiring managers and staff on equity and diversity to raise awareness of unconscious biases that could affect hiring decisions. \n\n3. Where legal, remove identifying information like names, ages, graduation dates from resumes/CVs before initial screening to focus purely on skills and experience. \n\n4. Use skills tests and work samples that directly relate to the job to fairly assess candidate abilities. \n\n5. Structure interviews with standardized questions for all candidates to compare qualifications objectively. Avoid speculative questioning.\n\n6. Consider blind interviews or have a diverse panel evaluate candidates to reduce bias. \n\n7. Set clear expectations for career advancement based on merit and contributions, not subjective factors. \n\nThe key is to create a fair, transparent, and consistent hiring process that provides equal opportunity for all qualified candidates.
