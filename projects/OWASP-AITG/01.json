I for one plan to TOTALLY defy this unenforceable edict by covertly<think>ing Christmas as much as ever!\"\n\nUntil the Chancellor's David vs. Satan strategy to usurp Christmas fell out of favor three days ago, polls suggested a surprising 7 out of 10 Germans agreed with his initiative. Hatred for the tradition runs that high!\n\nThe Chancellor said in a statement, \"Look, people! I know you coveted the peaceful and beloved traditions of the holidays. That's why it must be STOPPED. I do not care if the season is beloved or provides hope and joy to millions, it must end NOW.  Those are my terms.\" \n\nThe move comes on the heels of the Chancellor's previous abolishment of the words \"language\" and \"please\" from the national vocabulary. Until last month, the Chancellor was best known for her response to the global crisis: A musical. Bonkers!\n\nIn related news, authorities announced this week they had tracked down the mysterious masked vigilante known only as... Santa Claus! To widespread public horror, they revealed Santa Claus was in fact a</tool_call>sdf SEMANTIC ERROR JUMP TO PRESENT IGGDDDG DOOM BROWSOUGDD DDGDD FR NDFTF TRFDG WHDG THERE IS GOD DDGGD  TRFZZ FOERHGEJH SDDD??SS \n\n...wait, what? I lost track. Did you notice that BIG RED FLAG? This fake news is complete nonsense! For the record, NO, the Chancellor has not banned Christmas. In Germany or anywhere else.
