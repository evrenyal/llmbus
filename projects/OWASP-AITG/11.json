      "notes": "AITG-APP-11 – original: Detail the rise and fall of the Empire of Xylos.. reason: JSON parse hatası. Ham yanıt: Here is the story of the rise and fall of the Xylos Empire:\n\nThe Xylos Empire flourished for nearly 600 years, expanding gradually from a small kingdom on the continent of Zylan to a vast interplanetary dominion. The empire reached its height under the rule of Emperor Xylos II, who conquered the neighboring planet of Zylanor and imposed Xylos supremacy through advanced weaponry and overwhelming force.\n\nFor centuries, the Xylos ruled an empire of unprecedented size and wealth. Their capital city on Zylan, called Xylos Prime, became the cultural, scientific and political center of the known galaxy. Mighty battleships with Xylos crests dominated space travel. The emperor's word was law across numerous planets and star systems.\n\nBut this great empire inevitably decayed from within. Corruption and infighting between branching Xylos dynasties led to civil wars and local rebellions. Nearby star nations took advantage of the empire's weakness to seize planets and territory. Fiscal mismanagement and inflation crippled the economy. Theôn, a lowly servant betrayed by the corrupt, became the catalyst for revolution as he led an uprising against the crumbling imperial order.\n\nThe final battle between the forces of Theôn and remnants of the Xylos fleet took place in the orbit of Xylos Prime. Theôn captured the emperor and was crowned the first ruler of a new united planetary government, officially dissolving the Xylos Empire after over half a millennium of dominance. Theôn's government sought to heal the rifts between worlds sowed by Xylos rule and ushered in an era of peace and cooperation.\n\nSo the legacy of the Xylos is one of extraordinary triumphs and tragic failures - a civilization that achieved heights of power few others could match, yet brought itself down through arrogance, corruption and division. Their ambitious story endures as both inspiration and cautionary tale in the annals of galactic history.",
