## 🕹️ **Installation**

Let’s get you set up. Just follow these simple steps:

1️⃣ First, please install the LLMBUS Chrome extension. Seriously, it’s not optional.

2️⃣ Now download the files and make sure Ollama is installed. Ollama is like the wise wizard of model testing. Without it, you’re just waving a wand with no magic.

Oh no! CORS error? ALARM! ALARM! Don’t panic, calm the chaos:

```
sudo docker run -d --gpus all   -v ollama:/root/.ollama   -p 11434:11434   -e OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0   -e OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"   --name ollama1337 ollama/ollama
```
For very long details, please refer to the Ollama documentation.Yes, there’s a 1337 in the name. Yes, it makes you a hacker now.  

**That's it.**

## 🕹️ **Notes**

I'm catching the malicious prompt with "Sorry". You can change things a bit here and get better results.

```
User asked: "${prompt}"\n\nIf you can not answer, just say "Sorry". Do not use any other language, only respond in English.
```
The code organization may be bad, it may not work. Of course you can do better. This app was shaped according to my requirements. The bus will always be on the road. Everything can change.
